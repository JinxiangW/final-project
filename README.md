# Stylized Rolling Poster!

This is it! Here is our final Project!

## Design Doc 


### Introduction
- This idea is inspired from Wallpaper Engine, where lots of still visual graphics were recreated into animated wallpapers. Therefore we were also tempted to do the similar recreation, but with Unity and other DCC tools.
 This is a good chance to practice how to turn an aesthetical concept art piece into an interactive game scene.

### Goal

- General and transferable stylization techniques, in DCC tools or in game engine.
- Tricks that can achieve similar visual effects while maintaining a good performance.
- The capability to appreciate art.

### Main Features
- Procedural generated terrain and foliage and corresponding textures.
- Sea shader (animation, color, foam, reflection, depth based color)
- Sand shader (interact with sea)
- Skybox (stars, color gradient, moon)
- Cloud (volumetric cloud or billboard cloud)
- Scene props (lighthouse, stones, tiny creatures)
- Stylized Fonts
- Weather System(Rain, Snow, etc. )
- Interaction System(?)

### Techniques
- Use Unity for Custom Shader and Houdini for procedrual generated assets.
- Cel shading with distorted normal and utilization of ramp textures
- Some offline npr techniques could be used (rotating billboards) 
- Most of the similar effect is done with blender. So we will probably draw some inspiration from blender tutorials
